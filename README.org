* Stagedtt
Stagedtt is an experimental implementation of a staged dependent type theory.

* Installation
As =stagedtt= uses [[https://github.com/RedPRL/algaeff][algaeff]] for effects, we will need to use a version
of the OCaml compiler that supports effects.
Begin by running the following command:
- ~opam switch create stagedtt 5.0.0+trunk~

This will create a new [[https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/FAQ.html#What-is-a-quot-switch-quot][opam switch]] for =stagedtt=.

Next, run the following 2 commands to install =stagedtt=
- ~eval $(opam env)~
- ~opam install .~
* Usage 
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  stagedtt load examples/demo.stt
#+END_SRC
